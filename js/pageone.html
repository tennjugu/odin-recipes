      <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>Parboil your protein choice (meat or chicken) with the spices
            listed above. Remove from the water and set aside for later use</li>
          <li>Blend your red bell pepper, scotch bonnet, tomatoes, onions
             (three-quarter of your big onions), garlic and ginger and put to a
              boil till a thick paste is formed where there’s little or no water
              left.</li>
          <li>Fry your protein of choice in oil (I’m using olive oil) till
            it’s tender and golden brown then set aside. Meanwhile, wash and
            parboil your rice.</li>
          <li>In a stainless/aluminum pot or saucepan, heat a little of the
             left-over oil from frying your protein, sauté the rest of your
             ominous till it’s fragrant and translucent. Add a teaspoon of
             thyme and curry, white pepper to taste and one finger or a teaspoon
             of ground ginger alongside ground nutmeg.</li>
          <li>Add your canned tomato pastes and stir while frying. Fry till
            it has lost its acidic/sour taste. Then add the blended tomato-pepper
            mix and keep stirring while frying. At this point, get your
            meat/chicken water (stock) and add to the mix. Taste for seasoning
            and add your salt and/or seasoning cubes if needed.</li>
          <li>Add your parboiled rice to your stew base and stir till all the
             grains are coated with the stew base. Leave to simmer till all the
              water is absorbed.</li>
          <li>Check for doneness. Cover with a tight lid and leave to simmer
            for about 5 minutes then serve.</li>
        </ol>
